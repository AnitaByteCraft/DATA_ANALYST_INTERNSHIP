# Task-1: Netflix Dataset Cleaning

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic **data cleaning skills** on a Netflix dataset. The goal is to show that the dataset has been **prepared for analysis** by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing country information.

## Files
- `Cleaned_dataset.xlsx` → Excel version of cleaned data
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` → CSV version of cleaned data

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. Removed unnecessary helper columns (e.g., `title_clean`) to simplify the dataset.
2. Retained missing values in the `director` column as allowed by internship instructions.
3. Checked data types:
   - `date_added` formatted as Date
   - `release_year` is numeric
   - `rating` checked for consistency
4. Duplicates removed
5. Country information standardized

## Notes
- A new column `Data_Quality_Notes` was added to document cleaning actions.
- The cleaned dataset is ready for **analysis or visualization** tasks.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates an understanding of **data cleaning concepts** at a fresher internship level.
